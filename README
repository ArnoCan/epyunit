epyunit
=======

The 'epyunit' package provides extensions of the 
PyUnit framework for unit and regression tests of executables written in
arbitrary languages.
In distinction to some more comprising and though complex frameworks the 
'epyunit' provides a minimal but sufficient approach in particular for
the low-effort test automation of scripts and tools.

The reuse of the standard PyUnit in combination with PyDev 
provides out-of-the-box integration into the Eclipse-IDE.
Thus command line based regression tests as well as a graphical 
frontend for test statistics provided by PyDev could be applied. 

The epyunit components call the wrapped process and read the execution results
from STDOUT, STDERR, and the exit value. The values are read into Python 
variables either for further processing, or optional pass-through to the caller.
 
The 'epyunit' package provides in particular:

* Support for unit tests of shell scripts - **bash** - from command line and Eclipse/PyDev

* The simplified reuse of executables as test-dummies within multiple test cases.

* The categorization of structures defined by the directory tree. 

* The support of arbitrary intermixed implementation languages for executables.

The implementation supports Python(>=2.7) and integrates into the Eclipse IDE 
with PyDev, and PyUnit. 

The package 'epyunit' is a spin off from the project 'UnifiedSessionsManager-2.0'.
 
The main interface classes are:

* **FileSysObjectsMin** - A subset of the project PyFileSysObjects.

* **SystemCalls** - Adaptation of sub-process calls for unit tests.


The architecture is based on the packages 'PyDev'::

setup.py
--------

The installer adds a few options to the standard setuptools options.

* *build_sphinx*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Sphinx, html only. Calls 'callDocSphinx.sh'.

* *build_epydoc*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Epydoc, html only. Calls 'callDocEpydoc.sh'.

* *test*: Runs PyUnit tests by discovery.

* *--help-epyunit*: Displays this help.

* *--no-install-required*: Suppresses installation dependency checks, requires appropriate PYTHONPATH.

* *--offline*: Sets online dependencies to offline, or ignores online dependencies.

* *--exit*: Exit 'setup.py'.

After successful installation the 'selftest' verifies basic checks by:

  *epyunit --selftest*

with the exit value '0' when OK.

The option '-v' raises the degree of verbosity for inspection

  *epyunit --selftest -v -v -v -v*

VERSIONS and RELEASES
---------------------

**Planned Releases:**

* RELEASE: 00.00.00x - Pre-Alpha: Extraction of the features from hard-coded application into a reusable package.

* RELEASE: 00.01.00x - Alpha: Completion of basic features. 

* RELEASE: 00.02.00x - Alpha: Completion of features, stable interface. 

* RELEASE: 00.03.00x - Beta: Accomplish test cases for medium to high complexity.

* RELEASE: 00.04.00x - Production: First production release. Estimated number of UnitTests := 100.

* RELEASE: 00.05.00x - Production: Various performance enhancements.


**Current Release: 00.01.007 - Alpha:**

Major Changes:

* Introduce automation of PyDev and Eclipse integration by 'pydevd.py'.
  This includes also the start of independent processes from the commandline.
* Introduced a seperate module for subprocess units on top of
  the starter.

* The most may already work on Mac-OS and MS-Windows and others too, but due to 
  priorities for now tested and released for Linux. Others are following soon.
   
Current test status:

**REMARK**: Works already stable, but has still to be tested. Due to some
  urgent required ads for a contract I have to push it already to the public
  as reference, for the same reason require this now for the 'bash-core-lib' 
  family of extensions for the bash on the road to the cross platform 
  object oriented scripting platform including the new introduced shell-scriptlets.

**ATTENTION**: Some of the tests involve the remote debug feature of PyDev/Eclipse,
  thus require a running local RemoteDebugServer, see manuals.

* UnitTests: >9

* Use-Cases as UnitTests: >18

**Total**: >25
