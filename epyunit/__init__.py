"""The package 'epyunit' extends the standard PyUnit package for ExecUnits.

The reuse of features provided by PyUnit, including the integration into
PyDev gives access to a large set of Unit test features. This includes
the command line access as well as the Integration into the Eclipse IDE.

The application for tests of subprocesses as black-box tests enables the
test of arbitrary programming languages united under the cover of PyUnit
and PyDev.
