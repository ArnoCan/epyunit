Automation of Subprocess Debugging and Test-Integration of pydevd.py
====================================================================

The *PyDev* integration module for RemodeDebugServer provides an
interface for the automation of the load and application 
of the *pydevd.py* module.
The *PyDev* plugin - `<http://pydev.org>`_ - is the utilized embedded 
component for the debugging of Python based programs within 
Eclipse -  `<http://eclipse.org>`_ .

This includes particularly utilities for **cross-process debugging**
os subprocess calls by PyDev-Remote-Debugging_.

.. _PyDev-Remote-Debugging: http://pydev.org/manual_adv_remote_debugger.html


Application Basics
==================
Remote Debugging with PyDev within Eclipse in the raw form requires the frequent
modification of code for clear distinction of development and production systems.
The *PyDevRDC* utilities provide an approach designed to
be kept in code from development to production systems.  

The feature comprise in more detailed view:

* PyDevRDC - PyDev Eclipse Remote Debugging

  The main class for integration into the called subprocesses
  and their simplified setup for debugging based on pydevd.py.
  
* PYDEVD
  
  A predefined object for simple usage. 

Interworking and Dependencies
=============================
The module is foreseen in particular to support the debugging of 
subprocess calls for the analysis of unit tests.
      
The call is performed in two basic modes, the fully headless
mode 'cli' where stdout and stderr are buffered only, and the
mode 'dialogue', where no buffering is in place.
Thus in case of required error analysis a manual call in 'dialogue'
mode may help. 

Design
======

The basic workflow for the integration of processes initially not started
under control of 'pydevd.py' is depicted in the following figure.
Here started by a process from PyDev within Eclipse including the ePyDev 
package for the automation of the integration and start.

The UseCase '`UseCases.remote_debug <UseCases.remote_debug.html>`_'
is discussed here in detail, consisting of the components:

* UseCase: CallCase.py
  `[doc] <UseCases.remote_debug.calldir.html#module-UseCases.remote_debug.calldir.CallCase>`_
  `[source] <_modules/UseCases/remote_debug/calldir/CallCase.html#CallUnits.testCase000>`_

* Subprocess-Level-0: epyunit4RDbg.py 
  `[doc] <UseCases.remote_debug.subprocdir.bin.html#module-UseCases.remote_debug.subprocdir.bin.epyunit4RDbg>`_
  `[source] <_modules/UseCases/remote_debug/subprocdir/bin/epyunit4RDbg.html#MySubProcessLevel01.execute>`_

* Subprocess-Level-1: myscript.sh
  `[doc] <myscript-sh.html>`_
  `[source] <myscript-sh.html>`_


The following details of the designed control flow contain the required
Eclipse/PyDev actions, and the resulting code fragments
for the main steps of the control flow for the 
UseCase '`UseCases.remote_debug <UseCases.remote_debug.html>`_'.
Instead of the subprocess basically any Python based process could be started 
manually from the commandline and attaches itself to the PyDev plugin of Eclipse. 

#. **Eclipse-PyDev Framework: Start Remote Debug Server**

   Start the remote debug server process
   on the default listenning port localhost:5678.

#. **Parent-Process: Start main process**

   Start the primary process, e.g. for tests by testCase, or a UseCase.
   The example uses the context menue of PyDev/PyUnit to proceed.

     .. figure:: _static/pydev-remotedebugger1b.png
        :width: 300

#. **Parent-Process: Start subprocess**

   Start a process by the subprocess module. 
   This is wrapped into the class 'epyunit.SystemCalls',
   which covers the read of the process output, and the appropriate
   format transformation for ease of post-analysis of output from unit tests::

     # load SystemCalls
     from epyunit.SystemCalls import SystemCalls

     # create a controller
     sx = SystemCalls()

     # setup subprocess call string
     call = 'python '+tstcall

     # execute the subprocess
     ret = sx.callit(call)

#. **Subprocess: load and init 'pydevd.py'**

   Loads and initializes the PyDev stub for the connection to the Eclipse-PyDev gateway
   'pydevd.py'::

     # load debug stub-wrapper
     import epyunit.debug

   For the default initial debug controller stub refer to::

     epyunit.debug.PYDEVD

   The main action is here to detect and/or find and load the module 'pydevd.py' provided by PyDev.
   This depends of whether the process is started under the control of the PyDev debugger, or as a
   free running process/subprocess.
   The module is located due to the `PyDev manual <http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_remote_debugger.html>`_
   within the Eclipse plugin subtree at the relative filesystem position::

     eclipse/plugins/org.python.pydev_x.x.x/pysrc/pydevd.py

   **Remark**: This may vary e.g. in case of a drop-in installation.
 
   When working with various Eclipse versions the maintenance of the path could become cumbersome.
   Thus the scan function automates the search and filtering by intermixed 're', and 'glob' 
   based path search 
   ::

     epyunit.debug.PYDEVD


   For additional information on search options refer to 'scanEclipseForPydevd'
   `[doc] <pydeverdbg.html#scaneclipseforpydevd>`_ 
   `[source] <_modules/epyunit.debug.html#PyDevRDC.scanEclipseForPydevd>`_
   .

#. **Subprocess: startDebug**

   The debug session is started by the execution of the statement::

     # start debug session
     epyunit.debug.PYDEVD.startDebug()

#. **User Dialogue: start interactive session**

   The debug session is performed by the inspection of an arbitrary number of 
   expressions, e.g. by starting another nested subprocess::

     myproc = MySubProcessLevel01(_APPNAME)
     myproc.execute(_APPNAME)

#. **Debug Session: end debug session**

   f.f.s. / a.s.a.p.

Another example with **Basic Control**.

  Almost the same as before, but some basic parameters are
  set for some control.

  #. Include the following statements in the executable to be 
     started by another process::

       from epyunit.debug import PYDEVD
       
       _pydevdpath=/path/to/your/eclipse/directory
       _ignore=True
       _remotedebug=True
       
       PYDEVD.startRemoteDebug(
         pydevdpath=_pydevdpath,
         ignore=_ignore,remotedebug=_remotedebug,
       )
       
         

  #. Start a debugging server, see Remote Debugger @ Eclipse-PyDev_.
