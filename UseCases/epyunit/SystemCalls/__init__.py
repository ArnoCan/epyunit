"""Use-Cases for SystemCalls.

The examples of the documentation coded as executable PyUnit tests.
Therefore a wrapped dummy 'myscript.sh' with some prepared 
error cases is called. The result of STDOUT, STDIN, and EXIT
is evaluated due to some predefined check rules by command
line options. 

In addition a generic example for the demonstration of the 
'console' parameter is included.
